			<h5><p style="margin-top:0px;" class=" justify">Links to Other Sites<br>
			Our ADD-ON Websites may contain links to other, third party company websites that are not affiliated with ADD-ON (“Third Party sites”).

			<h5><p style="margin-top:0px;" class=" justify">Information Gathered and Tracked by ADD-ON<br>
			Organizational and Personal Information You Knowingly Give Us.<br>
			Within our ADD-ON Websites, you may be asked to provide personal or organizational information in order to make a purchase or receive information about a product or service. We collect this information through different methods, including:
			Registration Forms. We encourage all visitors to register with ADD-ON, although registration is not required, except for access to our premium content areas. The registration forms require users to give us accurate contact information (e.g. name and email address) and references that help us better serve you. Your name and email address may be used to send you information about our company, product updates, special offers, and newsletters. To opt out of receiving communications from ADD-ON, please Contact Us.
			Order Forms and Enrollment Forms. The information required on our order forms are used to process your orders quickly and accurately. Our order forms securely collect purchaser or enrollee contact and/or payment information (e.g. credit card number and other billing information). Because this information is used for order fulfillment, it will be necessary to share it with our Partners or Resellers who fulfill your request. Your contact information will only be used to send you the product you purchase. Your billing information will only be used to bill you for that product. During the purchasing process, you may be given the opportunity to sign up for future e-mailings regarding our products, services, and promotions. If you sign up, we will share your contact information with ADD-ON partner companies only, not with other outside companies. You may also be given the option of registering a profile with us, which would store your name, purchase history, and billing information to make it easier for you to shop and purchase products/services from us in the future. You may opt out of this feature at any time by changing/canceling your profile online.
</p></h5>

			
			<h5><p style="margin-top:0px;" class=" justify">ADD-ON may collect other information, including, but not necessarily limited to:<br>
			Contact information, such as name, physical address, telephone number(s), email address, and company. Most of the information collected under this category is business contact information. When it is collected in forms located on our ADD-ON Websites, it is protected using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.
			Transactional information, including information about the products and services you purchase or download, or about which you make an inquiry.
			User preferences, such as product requirements, areas of industry interest, newsletters, community choices and other information you select in the customer profile when registering on ADD-ON Websites, or indicated by your use of the ADD-ON
			Financial/credit card and payment information. Please see the “How ADD-ON Uses and Shares This Information” section for more information.
			Event and conference participation information, such as lectures, classes or booths attended or visited during an event or conference hosted or attended by ADD-ON. If we use electronic tracking technologies at an event, we will provide notice in the event registration materials and/or correspondence.
			Other information which may include, but is not limited to, browser and device information, data collected through automated electronic interactions, application usage data, demographic information, geographic or geo-location information, and/or statistical and aggregated information. Statistical or aggregated information does not directly identify a specific person, but may be derived from personal information. For example, we may aggregate personal information to calculate the percentage of users in a particular zip code.
			We may also supplement information you provide with information received from third parties.

			<h5><p style="margin-top:0px;" class=" justify">Information Gathered through Electronic Protocols.<br>
			
			Statistics and Information Collected as You Browse ADD-ON Websites
			As you browse our ADD-ON Websites, ADD-ON’s Web servers collect information about your visit, not about you personally. Via Web server logs, we monitor statistics such as:
			How many people visit our ADD-ON
			Which pages people visit on our ADD-ON
			From which domains our visitors come (e.g., "yahoo.com" or "aol.com").
			Which browsers people use to visit our ADD-ON
			We use these statistics to improve our ADD-ON Websites, monitor their performance, and make the sites more user-friendly for visitors.
			Our ADD-ON Websites also log Host Names (or IP addresses when the Host Name is not available) for systems administration and security purposes. These logs are monitored and analyzed to maintain systems and information security. They allow us to constantly improve the value and availability of the Web content.<br>
			Cookies<br>
			ADD-ON uses “cookie” technology to obtain information from on-line visitors. A “cookie” is a small, encrypted data string sent to your web browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. These “cookies” are used to compile information detailing the use of our site to help us better understand and meet the needs of our customers and business partners. To do this, they may collect a unique identifier, user preferences, profile information, and membership information, as well as general usage and volume statistical information. ADD-ON’s server will query your browser to see if there are “cookies” previously set by the ADD-ON Websites.
			We use “session ID cookies” and “persistent cookies” to deliver Web content specific to your interests and control access to restricted content. “Session ID cookies” expire when you close your browser. “Persistent cookies” remain on your hard drive after you leave our ADD-ON Websites. Most “persistent cookies” are set to expire between 90 and 365 days.
			A cookie cannot be used to access or otherwise compromise the data on your hard drive. While we do not offer an opt-out for cookies, most browsers provide you with the ability to accept or reject the cookie or alert you when a cookie is being used. You can also set your browser to refuse all cookies or accept only cookies returned to the originating servers. You can usually disable the cookie feature on your browser without affecting your ability to use the site. However in some cases, cookies are used as an essential security feature necessary for transaction completion, and may be required to complete certain functions on our ADD-ON Websites.
			</p></h5>	
			

			<h5><p style="margin-top:0px;" class=" justify"> Flash Cookies<br>
			
			
			ADD-ON may use flash cookies, also known as “local shared objects,” that employ Flash technology. “Flash cookies” are small files, on your computer that are used to remember the site’s settings. This technology enables us to personalize the look and feel of the site.<br>
			Embedded URLs<br>
			ADD-ON uses a tracking technique that employs embedded URLs to allow use of the site without cookies. Embedded URLs allow limited information to follow you as you navigate the site. It is not associated with personal information and expires when the session is terminated.<br>
			Embedded Pixels<br>
			On our ADD-ON Websites, we may use embedded pixel technologies on selected pages. This enables us to identify unique user visits to the ADD-ON Websites, as opposed to aggregate hits. Embedded pixels, in conjunction with other similar technologies, often developed by Third Parties and unaffiliated with ADD-ON, may be used in emails to provide information. This allows us to track marketing campaign responsiveness. Information collected using these technologies may be associated with the recipient's email address and is used solely for marketing and advertising purposes.<br>
			Third Party Cookies<br>
			ADD-ON has engaged one or more Third Party service providers to track and analyze usage and volume statistical information from visitors to the ADD-ON Websites, as well as to optimize and serve ads based on your past visits to our ADD-ON Websites. The service provider(s) set cookies on behalf of ADD-ON. One such service provider is Google Analytics. We also use other similar service providers. Both ADD-ON and its Third Party service providers use Display Advertising and Remarketing with Google Analytics. As a result of these cookies, third party vendors, including Google, will show our ads on sites across the Internet. You may opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising or customize Google Display Network ads by using the Ads Preferences Manager on Google's website.<br>
			Widgets<br>
			Our ADD-ON Websites include Widgets, which are interactive mini-programs that run on our site to provide specific services from another company (e.g., links to bookmarked sites). Some information, such as your email address, may be collected through the Widget. Cookies may also be set by the Widget to enable it to function properly. Information collected by this Widget is governed by the privacy policy of the company that created it and is not affiliated in any way with ADD-ON.
