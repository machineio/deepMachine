Because this information is used for order fulfillment, it will be necessary to share it with our Partners or Resellers who fulfill your request. Your contact information will only be used to send you the product you purchase. Your billing information will only be used to bill you for that product. During the purchasing process, you may be given the opportunity to sign up for future e-mailings regarding our products, services, and promotions. If you sign up, we will share your contact information with ADD-ON partner companies only, not with other outside companies. You may also be given the option of registering a profile with us, which would store your name, purchase history, and billing information to make it easier for you to shop and purchase products/services from us in the future.
