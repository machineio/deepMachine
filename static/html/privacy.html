			<h5><p style="margin-top:0px;" class=" justify">Information Gathered and Tracked by ADD-ON<br>
			Organizational and Personal Information You Knowingly Give Us.<br>
			Within our ADD-ON Websites, you may be asked to provide personal or organizational information in order to make a purchase or receive information about a product or service. We collect this information through different methods, including:
			Registration Forms. We encourage all visitors to register with ADD-ON, although registration is not required, except for access to our premium content areas. The registration forms require users to give us accurate contact information (e.g. name and email address) and references that help us better serve you. Your name and email address may be used to send you information about our company, product updates, special offers, and newsletters. To opt out of receiving communications from ADD-ON, please Contact Us.
			Order Forms and Enrollment Forms. The information required on our order forms are used to process your orders quickly and accurately. Our order forms securely collect purchaser or enrollee contact and/or payment information (e.g. credit card number and other billing information). Because this information is used for order fulfillment, it will be necessary to share it with our Partners or Resellers who fulfill your request. Your contact information will only be used to send you the product you purchase. Your billing information will only be used to bill you for that product. During the purchasing process, you may be given the opportunity to sign up for future e-mailings regarding our products, services, and promotions. If you sign up, we will share your contact information with ADD-ON partner companies only, not with other outside companies. You may also be given the option of registering a profile with us, which would store your name, purchase history, and billing information to make it easier for you to shop and purchase products/services from us in the future. You may opt out of this feature at any time by changing/canceling your profile online.
</p></h5>

			
			<h5><p style="margin-top:0px;" class=" justify">ADD-ON may collect other information, including, but not necessarily limited to:<br>
			Contact information, such as name, physical address, telephone number(s), email address, and company. Most of the information collected under this category is business contact information. When it is collected in forms located on our ADD-ON Websites, it is protected using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.
			Transactional information, including information about the products and services you purchase or download, or about which you make an inquiry.
			User preferences, such as product requirements, areas of industry interest, newsletters, community choices and other information you select in the customer profile when registering on ADD-ON Websites, or indicated by your use of the ADD-ON
			Financial/credit card and payment information. Please see the “How ADD-ON Uses and Shares This Information” section for more information.
			Event and conference participation information, such as lectures, classes or booths attended or visited during an event or conference hosted or attended by ADD-ON. If we use electronic tracking technologies at an event, we will provide notice in the event registration materials and/or correspondence.
			Other information which may include, but is not limited to, browser and device information, data collected through automated electronic interactions, application usage data, demographic information, geographic or geo-location information, and/or statistical and aggregated information. Statistical or aggregated information does not directly identify a specific person, but may be derived from personal information. For example, we may aggregate personal information to calculate the percentage of users in a particular zip code.
			We may also supplement information you provide with information received from third parties.
